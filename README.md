# Empowered Connections

Empowered Connections is an application meant to level up your networking. By creating new persons of interests you can track relationships in your network. By adding prompts to each person of interest you can stop meaningful relationships from following through the cracks. From your aunt Susie who's birthday you dont want to miss for the 3rd year in a row, to Jim a business consultant you met at a networking meeting last month. Empowered connections enables you to plan for engagment and let your mind rest at ease, knowing you've not forgoten that important meeting.

## Potential Future

With a networking application there are endless directions one could go. 

Im thinking about adding the following: 
1. omniauth with google.
2. integration with google calender api and maps. 
3. email notifications of upcoming prompts. 
4. engagement prompts based on your level a user provided importance scale.
